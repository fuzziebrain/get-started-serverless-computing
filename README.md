# Offload Data Processing with Serverless Computing

This project is a quick start guide with ready to run commands to get you started with developing [Oracle Cloud Functions](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/cloud-native/functions/) to be deployed to the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://oracle.com/cloud/).

The commands and instructions are written as a [Jupyter](https://www.jupyter.org/) Notebook. For the best experience, run them with the [Bash Kernel](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel).
